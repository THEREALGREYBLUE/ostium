# ostium
Awesome solution for those who want use of a computer but don't want to do do it any other way other than on a web page with the ability to upload and run programs remotely but with the feel of being done locally. In this way one could run software such as a favorite game or chat program and upload iso files, and  exe or bat files and then execute or run or view etc. Also included as an option from a virtua; desktop is the desk with a desktop, a laptop a tablet and several phones which can be used. run phone apps, make calls, run programs and browse sites within the site. When one arrives at the site ( https://ostium.norse.rocks/ostiummatrix ) they land in what appears to be a private office. A desk with all one needs to enjoy all the internet can offer all in one place. More to come....
